# GameOfLifeChallenge2025

 Crestron Game of Life Challenge 2025 Presented by Tim Gray.



**Participants of the live in person challenge will need the vtpro file and optionally the pdf of the presentation.**



#### What is the Game of Life?

[Conway's Game of life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life)   is a cellular automaton simulation  Complete Details are in the Wikipedia article linked.   The rules are simple.   

1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if by underpopulation.
2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.
4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
5. The playfield MUST be processed completely before updating.

Most implementations use a wrap around of the playfield,  left edge  checks the right edge as if it was a sphere, same for top to bottom.



Below is an example of a Glider, this will stay alive and move across the play field. There are many more stable shapes, the Wikipedia link is a great place to start.

 After the challenge is completed this repository will hold the Example solution in Simpl, Simpl+ and C#



#### **Things to Note**

Will the solutions be elegant perfect examples?  not a chance. but they will function. The code is not complete, there is no error checking code included for clairity.
